# K_finetuning_Pipelines
This repository contains the functions for the K-finetuning pipelines developed as part of my Master's project in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics at the Open University of Catalonia and the University of Barcelona. This work was supervised by Dr Pierre Hohmann and Dr Albane Ruaud between the months of February and June 2025.


**Functions.R** Contains the functions developed for the pipelines, as well as functions used for aiding plotting.

**pipeline_validation_ADA.RMD** Contains the RMarkdown for the metrics for the Toydataset and MBQC dataset across pipelines, as well as the study of alpha and beta diversity.

**ASV_table_merged_S1_S2_SILVA.csv** is the toy dataset, obtained from Zhang T, Li H, Ma S, Cao J, Liao H, Huang Q, Chen W.2023.The newest Oxford Nanopore R10.4.1 full-length 16S rRNA sequencing enables the accurate resolution of species-level microbial community profiling. Appl Environ Microbiol89:e00605-23.https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00605-23.

**OTU_table_family** is the processed MBQC dataset for our study. The raw files can be obtained from: Sinha, R., Abu-Ali, G., Vogtmann, E., et al. Assessment of variation in microbial community amplicon sequencing by the Microbiome Quality Control (MBQC) project consortium. Nat Biotechnol 35, 1077â€“1086 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3981.
